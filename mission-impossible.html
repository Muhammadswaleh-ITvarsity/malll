					 <H3>MISSION IMPOSSIBLE</H3>
<p>Ethan Hunt and his IMF team embark on a perilous mission to stop Gabriel, an operative working for a threatening artificial intelligence known as the Entity. Their pursuit takes them to the depths of the sunken Russian submarine,</p><p> the Sevastopol, where they aim to retrieve a critical component that can control the Entity. As they navigate a complex web of deceit and danger,</p><p>Luther Stickell sacrifices himself to prevent a nuclear bomb from detonating in London. With the Entity securely isolated on a drive, Ethan chooses to go into hiding,</p> <p> becoming its guardian to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. The film concludes with a sense of hope for the future, as the IMF team survives and new recruits are ready to carry the torch, while Ethan quietly withdraws from the public eye, safeguarding the world from unseen threats.</p>
